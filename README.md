Angular2-Leaflet-Starter
========================

A web mapping application starter based on Angular 2 and Leaflet. This project demo includes basic mapping functions:

-	[x] Display base maps from different sources

-	[x] Integrate Font-Awesome

-	[x] ~~Initialize map based on client's IP location (currently not working)~~

-	[x] Geocode address and zoom to result location

-	[x] Add/remove markers on the map

-	[ ] Create interactive marker popup

Working with [angular-2.0.0-rc4](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#200-rc4-2016-06-30).

See how it works at [demo page](http://haoliangyu.github.io/angular2-leaflet-starter/).
